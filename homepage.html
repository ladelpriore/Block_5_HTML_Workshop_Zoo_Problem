<p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have 
    been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.  Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new research into their 
    mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.
